The beginnings of a jQuery plugin that will allow you to time stamp an element, attach an event handler to it which will load
an audio file, and jump to the specified time stamp.

I chose to use the yayQuery podcasts as a demo because they taught me so much. Learn, and share. Thanks Rebecca Murphey, Adam Sontag, Alex Slexton, Paul Irish. Follow these people on github and twitter. You will learn a ton.
